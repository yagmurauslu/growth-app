SaaS Company Landing Page

This is part of my YouTube HTML/CSS tutorial on building a professional website for beginners.

This project is from the iCodeThis challenge website and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML and CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.



Steps to use Docker
docker build -t saas-landing-page:1 .
docker run -d -p 80:80 saas-landing-page:1
